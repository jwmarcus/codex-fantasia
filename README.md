## 🗺️ Philosophical Approach

Codex Fantasia operates on a few core principles:

1. **Play First**: Our primary goal is to get you playing these games, not just reading about them
2. **Respect Time**: We recognize modern players have different time constraints and provide options accordingly
3. **Celebrate Existing Work**: We highlight and connect to the best community resources rather than recreating them
4. **Thoughtful Curation**: Not every game deserves the same amount of attention—we guide you to experiences worth your time
5. **Modern Context**: We discuss these classics with both historical appreciation and contemporary perspective
