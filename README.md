# Codex Fantasia

*A nostalgic codex for classic JRPGs. Lore, stats, sprites—preserved and celebrated.*

## ✨ What is this?

**Codex Fantasia** is a fan-built digital bestiary and lore archive for the golden age of JRPGs. Inspired by classics like *Final Fantasy*, *Dragon Warrior*, *Chrono Trigger*, and *Earthbound*, it's a tribute to the characters, enemies, items, and absurdly specific elemental resistances we grew up memorizing.

This app will let users browse, search, and explore a cross-title database of iconic RPG data, with a UX built for joy and a backend written in TypeScript (because pain is growth).

## 🎮 Features (Planned)

- 📚 Deeply searchable database of JRPG enemies, items, skills, and lore
- 🖼️ Sprite and artwork viewing
- 🔎 Advanced filtering (status effects, elemental affinities, encounter rates, etc.)
- 🧩 Cross-title comparisons and trivia
- 💾 Save favorites, curate lists, and share them with others
- 🧠 Eventually: user-contributed content and wiki-style editing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node + Express (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma or similar ORM)
- **Storage**: TBD (likely S3 or Supabase)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Railway/Vercel/Fly.io TBD
