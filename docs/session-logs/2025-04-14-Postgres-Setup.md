# Session Log: PostgreSQL Setup and Verification

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Session Goal:** Install PostgreSQL in WSL, create the necessary database and user, configure the backend connection, and verify connectivity for the Codex Fantasia project.

## Key Steps & Interactions

*   User identified the need to install PostgreSQL in WSL.
*   Proposed and executed `sudo apt update` to refresh package lists.
*   Proposed and executed `sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib` to install PostgreSQL.
*   Attempted `sudo systemctl status postgresql`, which was interrupted.
*   Successfully checked status with `sudo service postgresql status`.
*   Connected to the database using `sudo -u postgres psql` to confirm server operation.
*   User confirmed using `postgres:postgres` credentials and `codex_fantasia_db` database name.
*   Provided SQL commands to set the user password (`ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';`) and create the database (`CREATE DATABASE codex_fantasia_db;`). User executed these commands in `psql`.
*   Read `codex-fantasia-server/.env` to check existing `DATABASE_URL`.
*   Edited `codex-fantasia-server/.env` to update the database name in `DATABASE_URL` to `codex_fantasia_db`.
*   Proposed and executed `cd codex-fantasia-server && npx prisma migrate status | cat` to verify the application's database connection via Prisma.

## Challenges & Workarounds

*   The `systemctl status postgresql` command did not provide clear output within WSL. Used `service postgresql status` instead, which worked.
*   The `psql` connection showed a non-critical "could not change directory" warning, which was explained as expected behavior.

## AI Contributions

*   Provided sequence of Linux commands for installing and managing the PostgreSQL service.
*   Provided SQL commands for user password setting and database creation.
*   Constructed the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
*   Identified the correct Prisma command (`prisma migrate status`) to test database connectivity from the application's perspective.
*   Explained the output of various commands.

## Developer Steering

*   Initiated the request for PostgreSQL setup.
*   Confirmed the choice of username, password, and database name.
*   Executed the SQL commands provided.

## Outcome & Links

*   **Result:** PostgreSQL 14 is installed and running in WSL. A database `codex_fantasia_db` and user `postgres` (with password `postgres`) are configured. The backend application at `codex-fantasia-server` is confirmed to successfully connect to this database via the updated `.env` file.
*   **Commits:** None directly in this session log, but this setup enables future backend commits.
*   **Issues Closed:** None.

## Learnings & Reflections

*   Standard PostgreSQL setup flow using `apt`.
*   Confirmed `service` command as a reliable alternative to `systemctl` for status checks in this WSL environment.
*   Using `prisma migrate status` is an effective way to validate the `DATABASE_URL` and Prisma's ability to connect early in development.
