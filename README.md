# Codex Fantasia

*Your nostalgic guide to discovering and playing classic JRPGs.*

## ‚ú® What is this?

**Codex Fantasia** is a discovery platform dedicated to helping people find and play classic JRPGs from the golden age. Whether you're a nostalgic veteran looking to revisit beloved worlds or a curious newcomer wondering where to start, we're here to guide your journey through these timeless adventures.

We don't aim to replace the incredible resources already created by the JRPG community. Instead, we connect you with the best existing guides, walkthroughs, and fan sites while providing the context and guidance you need to actually start playing.

## ü§ñ AI Collaboration & `.vibe` Directory

This project heavily utilizes AI pair programming assistants (like Cursor). To streamline this collaboration and maintain context, we use a dedicated `.vibe` directory at the project root.

**Purpose:**

*   Provides essential, up-to-date context for AI assistants.
*   Defines preferred interaction styles and coding conventions for AI collaboration.
*   Optionally logs the history of AI-assisted development sessions.

**Structure:**

*   `.vibe/context.md`: Core project context (vision, status, tech, key file pointers).
*   `.vibe/preferences.md`: Developer preferences for AI interaction and code style.
*   `.vibe/session_template.md`: Template for documenting AI pairing sessions.
*   `.vibe/sessions/`: Directory containing individual session logs (optional).
*   `.vibe/framework_rationale.md`: Explanation of this framework.

**Workflow:**

When starting a new coding session with an AI assistant:

1.  **Provide Initial Context:** Point the AI to the key files:
    ```
    @.vibe/context.md 
    @.vibe/preferences.md
    ```
2.  **Follow Preferences:** The AI should adhere to the guidelines in `preferences.md` during the session.
3.  **(Optional) Log Session:** For complex tasks, use the `[SessionLog Start/End]` markers in chat and ask the AI to summarize the interaction using the `session_template.md`, saving the result in the `sessions/` directory.

This approach helps maintain consistency, reduces repetitive context sharing, and makes the collaborative development process more transparent.

**How to Start a New Development Session (Using `.vibe`):**

This step-by-step guide explains how to efficiently start a new coding session using the `.vibe` system, ensuring the AI assistant is properly oriented.

1.  **Open the Project:** Ensure the `codex-fantasia` project folder is open in your AI-enabled IDE (e.g., Cursor).

2.  **Start a New Chat:** Initiate a *fresh* chat session with the AI assistant within the IDE. Do not rely on previous chat history, as context may be stale.

3.  **Provide the Initial Context Prompt:** Copy and paste the following *exact* prompt into the chat, **replacing the bracketed part** with your actual goal for the session:

    ```text
    Good morning! Let's continue working on Codex Fantasia. Please review the project context and our preferences by reading these files:
    @.vibe/context.md
    @.vibe/preferences.md

    Today, I'd like to focus on [mention your specific goal here, e.g., "implementing the basic User model routes" or "adding input validation to the game creation endpoint"].
    ```

    *   **Why this prompt?** It directs the AI to the core context (`context.md`) and your collaboration preferences (`preferences.md`), and provides immediate focus via your stated goal.

4.  **Wait for Confirmation (Optional):** Allow the AI to acknowledge processing the files. It might summarize its understanding or ask clarifying questions.

5.  **Begin "Vibe Coding":** Interact with the AI to achieve your stated goal, providing instructions, reviewing suggestions, etc.

6.  **(Optional) Use Session Logging:** Follow the steps outlined above under "Workflow" if you wish to document the session.

7.  **Commit Your Work:** Use standard `git` practices (ideally following Conventional Commits as per `preferences.md`) to save progress.

By following these steps, particularly step #3, you ensure the AI assistant has the necessary project knowledge and understands your preferred way of working from the outset.

## üó∫Ô∏è Philosophical Approach

Codex Fantasia operates on a few core principles:

1. **Play First**: Our primary goal is to get you playing these games, not just reading about them
2. **Respect Time**: We recognize modern players have different time constraints and provide options accordingly
3. **Celebrate Existing Work**: We highlight and connect to the best community resources rather than recreating them
4. **Thoughtful Curation**: Not every game deserves the same amount of attention‚Äîwe guide you to experiences worth your time
5. **Modern Context**: We discuss these classics with both historical appreciation and contemporary perspective

## üß™ Status

This is a nights-and-weekends passion project between friends. Expect slow progress but high polish.

## ü§ù Contributing

We're not accepting external contributors *yet*, but if you've got ideas or want to help with the project, feel free to open an issue for discussion.

## üìú License

TBD. Likely something open but protective of nostalgic intent.
