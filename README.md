## ü§ñ AI Collaboration & `.vibe` Directory

This project heavily utilizes AI pair programming assistants (like Cursor). To streamline this collaboration and maintain context, we use a dedicated `.vibe` directory at the project root.

**Purpose:**

*   Provides essential, up-to-date context for AI assistants.
*   Defines preferred interaction styles and coding conventions for AI collaboration.
*   Optionally logs the history of AI-assisted development sessions.

**Structure:**

*   `.vibe/context.md`: Core project context (vision, status, tech, key file pointers).
*   `.vibe/preferences.md`: Developer preferences for AI interaction and code style.
*   `.vibe/session_template.md`: Template for documenting AI pairing sessions.
*   `.vibe/sessions/`: Directory containing individual session logs (optional).
*   `.vibe/framework_rationale.md`: Explanation of this framework.

**Workflow:**

When starting a new coding session with an AI assistant:

1.  **Provide Initial Context:** Point the AI to the key files:
    ```
    @.vibe/context.md 
    @.vibe/preferences.md
    ```
2.  **Follow Preferences:** The AI should adhere to the guidelines in `preferences.md` during the session.
3.  **(Optional) Log Session:** For complex tasks, use the `[SessionLog Start/End]` markers in chat and ask the AI to summarize the interaction using the `session_template.md`, saving the result in the `sessions/` directory.

This approach helps maintain consistency, reduces repetitive context sharing, and makes the collaborative development process more transparent.

**How to Start a New Development Session (Using `.vibe`):**

This step-by-step guide explains how to efficiently start a new coding session using the `.vibe` system, ensuring the AI assistant is properly oriented.

1.  **Open the Project:** Ensure the `codex-fantasia` project folder is open in your AI-enabled IDE (e.g., Cursor).

2.  **Start a New Chat:** Initiate a *fresh* chat session with the AI assistant within the IDE. Do not rely on previous chat history, as context may be stale.

3.  **Provide the Initial Context Prompt:** Copy and paste the following *exact* prompt into the chat, **replacing the bracketed part** with your actual goal for the session:

    ```text
    Good morning! Let's continue working on Codex Fantasia. Please review the project context and our preferences by reading these files:
    @.vibe/context.md
    @.vibe/preferences.md

    Today, I'd like to focus on [mention your specific goal here, e.g., "implementing the basic User model routes" or "adding input validation to the game creation endpoint"].
    ```

    *   **Why this prompt?** It directs the AI to the core context (`context.md`) and your collaboration preferences (`preferences.md`), and provides immediate focus via your stated goal.

4.  **Wait for Confirmation (Optional):** Allow the AI to acknowledge processing the files. It might summarize its understanding or ask clarifying questions.

5.  **Begin "Vibe Coding":** Interact with the AI to achieve your stated goal, providing instructions, reviewing suggestions, etc.

6.  **(Optional) Use Session Logging:** Follow the steps outlined above under "Workflow" if you wish to document the session.

7.  **Commit Your Work:** Use standard `git` practices (ideally following Conventional Commits as per `preferences.md`) to save progress.

By following these steps, particularly step #3, you ensure the AI assistant has the necessary project knowledge and understands your preferred way of working from the outset.

## üó∫Ô∏è Philosophical Approach

Codex Fantasia operates on a few core principles:

1. **Play First**: Our primary goal is to get you playing these games, not just reading about them
2. **Respect Time**: We recognize modern players have different time constraints and provide options accordingly
3. **Celebrate Existing Work**: We highlight and connect to the best community resources rather than recreating them
4. **Thoughtful Curation**: Not every game deserves the same amount of attention‚Äîwe guide you to experiences worth your time
5. **Modern Context**: We discuss these classics with both historical appreciation and contemporary perspective

## üß™ Status

This is a nights-and-weekends passion project between friends. Expect slow progress but high polish.

## ü§ù Contributing

We're not accepting external contributors *yet*, but if you've got ideas or want to help with the project, feel free to open an issue for discussion.

## üìú License

TBD. Likely something open but protective of nostalgic intent.

## üöÄ Local Development Setup

This section guides you through setting up the necessary backend components locally, primarily the PostgreSQL database. These instructions assume a Debian-based Linux environment (like Ubuntu under WSL).

1.  **Install PostgreSQL:**
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
    ```

2.  **Start and Verify PostgreSQL Service:**
    Start the service (if not already started) and check its status:
    ```bash
    sudo service postgresql start
    sudo service postgresql status 
    # Look for "online" or similar confirmation
    ```

3.  **Create Database User and Database:**
    Connect to the PostgreSQL command line as the default `postgres` user:
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
    Inside the `psql` prompt, run the following SQL commands. We'll use the username `postgres` and database name `codex_fantasia_db` as defaults used in the project setup. **It's recommended to change the password in a production setting.**
    ```sql
    -- Set a password for the default postgres user (replace 'postgres' if desired)
    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres'; 
    
    -- Create the database
    CREATE DATABASE codex_fantasia_db;

    -- Exit psql
    \q 
    ```

4.  **Configure Backend Environment (.env):**
    Navigate to the backend directory (`cd codex-fantasia-server`). If it doesn't exist, create a file named `.env` by copying `.env.example` (if one exists) or creating it from scratch. Ensure it contains the `DATABASE_URL`:
    ```env
    # .env file in codex-fantasia-server/
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/codex_fantasia_db"
    
    # Add other environment variables like AUTH0_DOMAIN, AUTH0_AUDIENCE etc. here
    # AUTH0_DOMAIN=...
    # AUTH0_AUDIENCE=...
    ```
    *Replace user (`postgres`), password (`postgres`), host (`localhost`), port (`5432`), and database name (`codex_fantasia_db`) if you used different values in step 3.*

5.  **Verify Database Connection via Prisma:**
    From the `codex-fantasia-server` directory, run the Prisma status command:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate status
    ```
    If successful, Prisma will report the status of migrations and confirm it can connect to the database specified in your `.env` file. If you encounter errors, double-check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and ensure the PostgreSQL service is running.

6.  **(Optional) Seed the Database:**
    Once the connection is verified, you might need to apply migrations and seed data (commands TBD, likely `npx prisma migrate dev` or `npx prisma db push` followed by a seed script).

Now you should have a working local database connection for the backend server.
